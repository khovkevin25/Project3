Welcome to the Fabulous Food Accesibility Team
We've created visualizations so governments, students, Philadelphians, or anyone else can better understand food accessibility in Philly. :

Our team consists of:
Caleb Williams
Geniya Merriweather
Kevin Khov
Jen Foster
Kehloboe Gongloe
Emilio Kamanousa
We are (mostly) a group of Philadelphians who want to better understand our city and help improve it.

We have used a series of data sets gathered from the USDA and the City of Philadelphia
