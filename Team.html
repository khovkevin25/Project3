<h1>Welcome to the Fabulous Food Accesibility Team</h1>
<p>We've created visualizations so governments, students, Philadelphians, or anyone else can better understand food accessibility in Philly. :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our team consists of:</li>
    <li>Caleb Williams</li>
    <li>Geniya Merriweather</li>
    <li>Kevin Khov</li>
    <li>Jen Foster</li>
    <li>Kehloboe Gongloe</li>
    <li>Emilio Kamanousa</li>
</ul>
<p>We are (mostly) a group of Philadelphians who want to better understand our city and help improve it.</p>
<p>We have used a series of data sets gathered from the USDA and the City of Philadelphia</p>
